In the previous step, we kickstarted the creation of a scale set and I saw that the deployment was

complete.

It took about five minutes for the deployment to be complete, and we are now ready to go to the resource.

So let's go to the resource.

The resource which we have created is a VM scale set.

You can see that this VM scale set also has a public IP address.

You can see that the status is two out of two succeeded.

That basically means two instances are successfully created.

Now how can you see the instance information?

You can go over to instances in here.

If you go over to instances, you can see that there are two VM instances which are created in here.

You can see that the first instance has number zero at the end, and the second instance has number

one at the end.

And if you go into this specific instance, you can see that this also has a public IP address.

If you copy the public IP address and go over to the specific instance and say enter, make sure that

you're using HTTP and not Https.

And then you should see something like this come up.

Welcome to in 28 minutes VM scale 000000.

So this is the name of the virtual machine.

And that's what we are seeing in here.

If you don't see this message, make sure that you're using HTTP.

If you're using HTTP and still don't see this specific message, wait for a few minutes and it should

be fine.

I'll close this out.

And if I go back to the scale, set instances and go to VM scale.

Set one one.

And go over to the public IP address and 21 148 176.

You can see that this is showing VM scale 000001.

And this is the name of the second instance which is present in here.

If I go back to the VM scale set instances, you can also see that there is load balancing in here.

So if you go to load balancing in here.

You would see that a load balancer is also configured for us.

You can see the IP address of the load balancer.

So you can also copy this.

So for 147 136 175.

If you go and type in that IP address for 147 136 175, you would see that it would route the request

to one of the virtual machines in the background.

So the request is going into 501.

If you see the request hanging, it might be because you're using Https.

So make sure that you're using HTTP.

Even after trying multiple times I saw that all the requests were going to 0001, and none of the requests

were going to 0000.

This is because some of the times your browser would cache the requests.

And how do we avoid the browser cache?

Let's fire the request from command line.

How can I fire the request from command line?

I can go and open up Cloud Shell so I can go in here.

Click Cloud Shell.

So this is opening up Cloud Shell.

And from here I can send a request.

Let's do a clear so that we can see the command clearly in here.

Let's maximize this.

And if you want to send a request to a URL.

So I want to send a request to this URL.

The command in Linux is curl curl http colon slash slash and the IP address.

So this would send a HTTP request to this specific IP address.

This is like launching something in the browser.

This would actually get the HTML response and show it here.

So you can see that the first response is coming back from VM scale 0001.

The next one is coming from 0000.

If you keep fighting it multiple times, you would see that you would get the response back from one

of the active instances.

So I'll minimize this.

I'll say restore.

And let's go back to instances.

You can use one of these instances and say delete.

So this action will delete the instances including their disks.

You want to delete the selected instances I'll say yes apply force delete.

Yes please.

So this instance is in a state of deleting right now.

And if I maximize this and do a curl in here, you can see that all the requests would start coming

only from the second instance.

So you can see that all the requests are being handled by the second instance only.

And if I minimize this after a while, you would see that the virtual machine instance is deleted.

And right now there is only one virtual machine instance in here.

If you want, you can increase the number of instances as well if you type in scaling in search.

So there is a menu item called scaling.

You can either type scaling in here or take the difficult way which is to scroll down here slowly.

And over here you would you'd see scaling.

So you can go to scaling.

And you can say I want to manually scale.

And I can also increase the number of instances.

Let's say I would want to create 10 or 100 instances.

You can increase the number of instances in here as well.

In this step we looked at virtual machine scale sets.

If you want to create hundreds of similar virtual machines, VM scale sets simplify the entire process.

VM scale sets provide high availability to your application.

You can also add in a load balancer.

The load balancer would automatically distribute the load between the active instances using a Virtual

Machine scale set.

You can also distribute instances across multiple availability zones.

VM scale sets also support manual scaling and auto scaling as well.

I'm sure you're having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
