Welcome back. In this step,

let's look at Azure App Service. As we discussed earlier, Azure App Service is a Platform as a Service

offering from Azure. It is a fully-managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling your web applications.

You can deploy web applications, REST APIs.

You can deploy mobile back ends to App Service as well.

It supports a wide variety of languages;

.NET, .NET Core, Node.js, Java, Python, PHP.

You can deploy applications which use any of these languages and with a few clicks of a mouse, you

can deploy a highly-available application to Azure App Service. Before you'd deploy an application to Azure App

Service, a important thing that you need to choose is a App Service Plan.

You need to define the hardware or the compute resources that you would want for your web application.

There are a wide variety of plans that are available.

You need to choose the one which is right for your circumstances.

Azure App Service offers a number of services; automatic deployment and management, auto-scaling,

and built-in load balancing, I'll see you in the next step,

where we would get our hands dirty with App Service.
