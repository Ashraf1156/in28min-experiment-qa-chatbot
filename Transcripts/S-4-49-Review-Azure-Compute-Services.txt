Welcome back. In this step,

let's review some of the things that we have learned about the different Azure Services for Compute. The

first one which we looked at is Azure VMs.

This is Infrastructure as a Service.

You can create Windows or Linux VMs.

You'd go for Azure VMs when you would need complete control over your operating system

or you'd want to run custom software on your virtual machines.

However, the biggest disadvantage of going for Azure VMs is that you need to handle availability,

scalability, load balancing, software or OS update, and things like that.

You need to manage scale sets, load balancers, and things like that.

If you'd want to make things easy for you, you would go for Azure App Service.

This is Platform as a Service. You can deploy web apps, mobile back ends, REST APIs which are created

in different languages.

You can also deploy containers and it provides built-in auto-scaling and load balancing.

The next service which we talked about is related to containers, Container Instances.

This is Platform as a Service.

You can also call it Container as a Service.

Typically, Container as a Service is part of Platform as a Service.

With Azure Container Instances, you can run isolated containers, but it does not offer any complex orchestration

features. With Azure Container Instances,

you don't need to worry about provisioning and managing VMs.

You just configure the software.

You configure what container you want, how you want to scale it, and you'll be able to get up

and running with your containers in a few seconds.

The next service which we looked at is Azure Kubernetes service. It is again Platform as a

Service. It's Container as a Service offering, but it provides powerful container orchestration features

which are typically needed in microservices architectures.

It is a Managed Kubernetes Service.

Azure Service Fabric is again Platform as a Service, Container as a Service container orchestrator solution.

However, it is Microsoft-customized container orchestrator solution.

Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a open-source container orchestrator solution. Azure Service Fabric also is very,

very useful in case of microservices architectures.

You can run Azure Service Fabric anywhere, you can run it on-premises and also in the cloud.

The last thing that we looked at is Azure Functions.

It comes under the category of Serverless. Sometimes

these are also called Functions as a Service, FaaS.

So, this provides compute for event-driven apps.

You can trigger a function on a HTTP call, or when a queue, or when a message is placed on a queue, or on different

other events.

In this step, we looked at some of the important compute offerings in Azure.

I'm sure you are having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
