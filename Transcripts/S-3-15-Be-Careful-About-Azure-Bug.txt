Be careful about an Azure Bug
In the next step, we use machine size B1S.

I'm receiving feedback that this machine size is NOT available in all regions(In spite of promises from Azure that B1S is the recommended free tier machine size).

A couple of regions which learners had success with - Central India, Australia East.

All updates will be available here - https://www.udemy.com/course/azure-certification-az-900-azure-fundamentals/learn/#questions/17155278/
