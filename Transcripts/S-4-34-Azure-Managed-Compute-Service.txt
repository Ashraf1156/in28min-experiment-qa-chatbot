Welcome back.

In the last section, we learned how to create virtual machines, how to load balance between them

using load balancing, and how to create scale sets. Managing virtual machine, scale sets, and load balancing

is a very manual thing.

How do we automate all these?

That's where we go for Managed

Compute Services. In this section, we will understand the fundamentals of Infrastructure as a Service,

we will understand what is Platform as a Service, we will understand what is Software as a Service,

and we'll also look at some of the important managed compute services that are provided by Azure. We will

be getting started with Azure App Service, which makes it very, very easy to deploy applications to

Azure. When you're using Azure App Service, you don't need to worry about virtual machines or you don't need

to worry about load balancing.

You just tell App Service, this is a web application I would want to run and App Service would take care of everything

that you would need. After exploring App

Service, we would move towards Containers. We will understand what is a container, why we need containers, and

we would look at the different services related to containers in Azure.

We'd be looking at Azure Container Instances,

we'd be looking at Azure Kubernetes Service, and we will be looking at Azure Service

Fabric. From Containers, we will switch our attention to Serverless. We will understand what is serverless

and we will also understand how to create Serverless functions

using Azure functions. At the end of the section, we will also learn what is a shared responsibility model,

and we'll explore some of the important scenarios when it comes to managed compute services in Azure.

I'm sure you are all excited to get started with Managed Compute Services and I'll see you in the next

step.
