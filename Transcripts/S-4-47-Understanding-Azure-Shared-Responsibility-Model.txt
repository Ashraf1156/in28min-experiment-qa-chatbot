Welcome back. In this step, let's talk about Shared Responsibility Model. In the last few steps, we talked

about Infrastructure as a Service,

we talked about Platform as a Service, Software as a Service,

and the other deployment model which is present is On-prem;

you deployed the software completely on-premises.

What are the responsibilities in different models?

That's what we'll be looking at right now.

If you have your applications deployed On-prem, then you are responsible for all the different things

which you see in here.

You are responsible for your data center, the network, and the physical host.

You are responsible for the security of all these as well.

You are responsible for operating system,

the applications. You are, you are responsible for accounts and identities, devices, and your

information and data.

One important thing that you are observing in here is in all the models, whether it's Software as a

service, Platform as a Service, or Infrastructure as a Service, you are responsible for your devices,

your accounts, and your information.

The ownership of all these is always with the customer.

However, when you move to the cloud, when you are making use of IaaS, or PaaS, or Software as a Service

you are no longer responsible for physical host, or physical network, or the physical data center.

All these responsibilities are taken over by the cloud provider, which in this case is Microsoft or

Azure.

When you are using Infrastructure as a Service, you take the responsibility of the operating system,

the network controls, applications, and also the management of identity and directory infrastructure

for your application. When you go for PaaS, you relinquish some of the control over to Microsoft.

You are no longer worried about the operating system at all.

You are only responsible for your application code and a little bit of configuration.

When you're going for Software as a Service, you are only responsible for the configuration of your

identity,

who is going to use this

software. All the rest of the things are taken care of by the cloud provider.

So, you can see that whenever you are On-prem, everything is your responsibility.

However, when you're moving things to the cloud, when you're going for IaaS, or PasS, or Software

as a Service, you're moving towards a shared responsibility model.

Some of the things are responsibility of the cloud provider, which is Microsoft.

Some of the things are responsibilities of yours,

who's the customer.

The idea behind this step is to get a 10,000 feet overview around the shared responsibility model.

I'm sure you're having a wonderful time and I'll see you

in the next step.
