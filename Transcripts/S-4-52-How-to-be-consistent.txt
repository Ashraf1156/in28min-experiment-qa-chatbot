Ranga: Congratulations on reaching the second milestone

of this course.

Do you know when you learn the most

and when you retain most of what you learn?

Whenever you're learning something new,

you want to learn a lot of things,

and also, you want to remember what you have learned

for a long time.

I found that my best learning happens

when I'm being consistent.

For me, few hours a day for a week or a month consistently

is better than spending

an entire weekend learning something new.

In my experience,

when I spend a entire weekend learning something new,

I see that I might remember it

at that particular point in time,

but I don't remember it for a long period of time.

I found that if I wanted to remember something

for a long time,

if I'm learning something which is really, really important,

I would want to make use of it day in, day out.

In that kind of scenario,

learning consistently a few hours a day

for a week or a month will help you to learn better,

and also, remember better.

The question is, "How do you make yourselves

to be consistent?"

The first step is to have a learning plan.

What I would recommend you to do

is to sit down and write down your learning plan

for the next two weeks.

Be really, really specific,

include lecture numbers you'd want to complete as well.

For example, day 1, I would want to complete

from lectures 10 to 18.

Day 2, I would want to complete lectures 19 to 25.

Day 3, I would want to complete lectures 26 to 33.

So have your learning plan ready.

And the second step is really, really important,

put it somewhere near your desk,

put it in a place where you can see it every day.

Creating a plan and making it visible increases the chances

of you reaching your goals by more than 50%.

So my recommendation is to go ahead,

create your learning plan,

put it somewhere where you can see,

and I would love it if you can post your learning plan

in the Q&A as well.

I'm sure you're having a great time,

and I'm excited to see you in the next step.
