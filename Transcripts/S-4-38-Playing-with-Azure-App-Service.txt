In the previous step, we started creation of our App Service. If I go to App Services, I can see that the App Service

that we created is up and running. Let's go in and over here, you can see the URL. Let's copy the URL

and type it in. Within a minute or so,

you should see this come up.

Your app service is up and running.

You can see that it's very, very easy to deploy an application using App Service.

Similar to virtual machines, you have Activity log, where you can look at all the activity that is performed

inside your

App Service.

If you type scale in here, you'd be able to look at Scale out.

This is where you can go in and you can increase the number of instances.

You can say, let's say, I would want to have two instances or three instances.

So, let's say I would want to have two instances. All that

I would need to do is to go ahead and say Save.

So, this would increase the number of instances to two.

So, this is Scale out where we are increasing the number of instances.

In addition to Scale out, you can also do a Scale up, that's basically changing your

App Service Plan.

The App Service Plan is the thing which decides the hardware that is associated with your virtual machine.

You can see that we have chosen a B1 plan which gives us 1.75 GB memory

and there are a specific set of features which are included in here.

You can see that this specific plan gives you manual scaling.

However, if we'd want to run production workloads, you might want to go with Production App Service plans.

You can see that these plans give you more memory and also more features.

So, with a production plan. So, let's say if you'd go for this particular one, in that kind of scenario,

you can also do auto-scaling.

You'll also be able to create multiple environments.

So, not just a single environment, you can create a Dev, QA, Stage, and Production environments and you can

deploy applications to them.

You also get daily backups. As you can see, as you Scale up, as you change the plan for your App Service,

you would get more features, and you'd get more hardware.

This is common across most Platforms as a Service offerings.

You cannot access the virtual machines which are present underneath, but you can configure how much

hardware you want.

Over here, we are changing the amount of memory that we would want.

We are also configuring how many instances we would want to run.

We are configuring what kind of features we would want.

So, with Platform as a Service, you cannot change the underlying hardware, but you can change the configuration

that is related to this specific hardware needs of a specific application. Similar to virtual machines,

if you go to Overview and scroll down, you can see the utilization, you can see the CPU Percentage

utilization, Memory Percentage, Data In, Data Out;

all the metrics are coming in here.

These metrics are being tracked by Azure monitoring. In this step, we got a 10,000 feet overview of

the App Service.

I'm sure you are having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
