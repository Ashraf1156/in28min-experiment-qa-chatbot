COURSE FAQ : Do NOT worry about Subscription Name
ðŸ‘‰ FAQ 1: Azure subscription 1
1. Hello Ranga! I am enjoying the course so far but in Chapter 10. Step 2, Creating a VM, unfortunately I am seeing only the 'Azure subscription 1' even though I have signed up for an a Azure free account. Please help in this case.

2. Is "Azure Subscription 1" the same as "Free Trial" subscription?



ðŸ‘‰ SUMMARY
If Azure subscription 1 is your ONLY subscription, it should be a Free Trial subscription.
