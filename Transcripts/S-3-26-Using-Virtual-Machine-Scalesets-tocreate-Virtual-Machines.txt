In the last few steps we have created a couple of virtual machines.

We created them one by one.

What if I would want to create ten virtual machines?

Or I would want to create 100 virtual machines?

I don't want to create them one by one.

How can I create them as a group?

That's where a concept of scale set comes into picture.

In this step, let's explore the concept of a scale set.

What is a virtual machine scale set?

How do you simplify creation and management of multiple virtual machines?

That's where we would go for virtual machine scale sets.

It allows you to create and manage a group of virtual machines.

It provides you high availability to your applications.

If instead of one VM you have multiple VMs, the chance that your application is highly available is

very high.

In addition to creating multiple VMs, you can also add a load balancer when you're creating a virtual

machine scale set.

If I'm having multiple virtual machines and a user request comes in, I would want to be able to distribute

the requests among all the available virtual machines.

That's what a load balancer allows us to do.

In addition, you can also distribute VM instances across multiple availability zones.

So when you are creating a virtual machine scale set, you can say I would want my instances in availability

zone one, zone two, and zone three as well.

This would ensure that the instances are distributed across multiple availability zones.

And even if one of the availability zones is not available, your application can still be served from

the other availability zones.

Virtual machine scale sets also support manual scaling and auto scaling.

You can say I would want to create five instances a A little later you can say, I would want to increase

the number of instances to seven, or you would want to decrease the number of instances to three.

This is what is called manual scaling.

You can also do auto scaling based on the number of requests received.

Based on CPU utilization of your virtual machines, you can automatically increase the number of instances

and automatically decrease the number of instances as well.

And using virtual machine scale sets, you can create up to 1000 VM instances.

So if you want to create a group of virtual machines together and you want to manage them together,

that's when you would go for virtual machine scale set.

When you're creating a virtual machine scale set, you will have the option of adding a load balancer.

The load balancer would distribute the incoming requests between the existing VMs.

You will also have the option of distributing the VMs across multiple availability Zones and virtual

Machine scale sets also have the option of auto scaling based on CPU utilization or any other metric.

You can automatically increase the number of instances or decrease the number of instances.

In addition, you also have the option of manual scaling.

Basically, you can say I want ten instances and at a later point in time you can increase it to 15

or decrease it down to seven.

All this can be manually done as well.
