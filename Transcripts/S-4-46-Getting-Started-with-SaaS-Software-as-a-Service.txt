Welcome back. In the

last few steps, we talked about Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service.

One other offering which is also popular is SaaS or Software as a Service.

What is SaaS? SaaS comes into picture when you have centrally hosted software, mostly on the cloud, and you

are offering the software on a subscription basis.

A good example is let's say, I talk about Outlook 365, or Microsoft Office 365, or Gmail, or Google Docs.

These are services which are offered on the cloud.

These are email, calendaring and office tools. To make use of this,

I don't need to worry about hardware, or software, or applications.

All that I need to do is to log in with the right IDs

and I can go ahead and create my documents, or I can write my emails, or I can manage my spreadsheets.

These kind of software are part of Software as a Service category.

The users of this software don't need to worry about any of the details behind the software, or hardware,

or the applications that are used to run these applications.

Other SaaS examples include CRM applications, ERP applications, and document management tools.

With all these, you only worry about the configuration.

You don't worry about how the applications are architectured or built.

If the SaaS software is provided by a cloud provider, then the cloud provider is responsible for the OS

including upgrades and patches, application runtime.

The cloud provider is responsible for auto-scaling, availability, load balancing, application code,

application configuration.

Customer is only responsible for configuring the software. If you're making use of Gmail, login and

send your emails,

that's what your responsibility is.

You don't really care.

You don't really care what language is used to build Gmail or what happens behind the screens with servers

and things like that.

The same is the case with Outlook 365 or Microsoft Office 365.

All these are part of a category called Software as a Service.

I'm sure you're having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
