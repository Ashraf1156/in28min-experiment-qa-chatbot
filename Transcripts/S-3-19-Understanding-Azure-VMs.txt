In the last few steps, we created a virtual machine and we connected to it.

In this step, let's look at the key concepts that you need to remember with respect to Azure Virtual

Machines.

Let's get started with the most important one, which is the image.

Whenever I'm creating a virtual machine, I need to choose what operating system I would want on this

specific virtual machine.

Should I want Windows 11 or windows 12, or do I want a specific distribution of Linux?

Should I want ubuntu or which distribution of Linux I would want to choose?

This is decided by choosing the image.

A image helps you to choose the right operating system and the software you would want to install on

that specific virtual machine.

So image decides the operating system and software.

The next two things are related to the hardware.

VM family helps you to choose the right family of hardware.

There are different types of applications that you might want to run on the virtual machines.

You might want to run a simple web application.

In that kind of scenario, a general purpose virtual machine is more than sufficient.

However, there might be scenarios where you would want a lot of memory on your virtual machine.

For example, if you want to have a cache when you have a cache, you need to have a lot of memory.

Sometimes you might be having situations where you would need high performance compute, or you might

be running graphic processing applications.

In that kind of scenario, you might need a GPU.

So there are different types of hardware configurations you might want to choose.

When you create a virtual machine, you can choose the right family of hardware by choosing the right

VM family.

And inside the same VM family there are different sizes that are available.

These are called VM sizes.

For example, earlier we choose b1 s along with b1 B1S, you would also have something like B2S, and

so on and so forth.

This allows you to choose this specific quantity of hardware.

I want one CPU and two GB of memory, or I would want two vCPUs and four GB of memory.

This is what VM size helps you to choose.

So image is the operating system and software VM family and VM size helps you to choose the hardware

you would want on the virtual machine.

And the last one is disks.

Whenever you want to store something on your virtual machine, you need to attach a disk with your virtual

machine.

You'd want to store the operating system on the boot disk.

You might want to store some data on a disk and attach it with the virtual machine as well.

This is very, very similar to how we attach hard disks with our computers.

So you want to store things in your virtual machine.

That's where this come into picture.

You can attach virtual disks with your virtual machines.

This is also called block storage.

We will talk about the different types of storage.

And we'll also talk about block storage in depth a little later in the course.

Let's now look at all these in action.

We want to see image VM family, VM size and disks.

If you go back to the Azure portal, what I will do is actually click the hamburger portal and do a

right click on the home.

And I would say Open link in new tab.

So we will use this tab to use the command line.

Let's actually click here.

So this would so the hamburger menu would disappear.

And over here I have the command line.

And in the next step I'll make use of the Azure Portal web application over here.

Let's go over to Virtual Machines.

And I would want to create a new virtual machine.

So when I'm creating a new virtual machine, if you scroll down in here, one of the important choices

that we need to make is image.

As I said earlier, image helps you to choose the base operating system for the virtual machine.

Over here you can see that ubuntu is the default.

If you want, you can also click See all images.

If you click See All images, you would see that there are a wide variety of images which are supported

in here.

Over here you can see ubuntu, Debian.

If you scroll down, you'll also see Red Hat Enterprise Linux and a lot of other distributions of Linux

as well.

And if you want to make use of windows, you can also type in windows.

In here you'd see that there are a lot of windows options which are present in here as well.

So the image helps you to choose what operating system that you would want to make use of to run your

virtual machine.

Let's go back to create a virtual machine.

Once you choose the operating system, that's the image.

The next thing would be to choose the hardware.

That's where the machine family and the size becomes really, really important.

If you click See All Sizes in here, you can see that there are a lot of different sizes which are present

in here.

I'll click this in here.

So I'll minimize this.

And you would see that there are different types of series which are present.

So you have D series, B series E series.

So D b e.

These are all machine families.

You can see that D family is recommended for general purpose workloads.

B series is recommended for workloads that do not need continuous full CPU performance.

You can see that E series is recommended when you need high memory.

You don't really need to remember all the families which are present in here.

All that you need to remember is that whenever you want to create a virtual machine, you would want

to choose the hardware, and the hardware is enabled by choosing the right family and inside the family

you would choose the right VM size.

For example, if I expand B series in here, all these things which you see in here belong to B series.

That's the B family.

And inside that you can see that there is B1SB2, SB2, MSB1LS and a wide variety of other sizes.

Now what is the difference between B-1s and b-2s?

You can see that B-1s has one Vcpu one gig of Ram, and you can have two data disks attached with it.

However, when it comes to B-2s, the hardware configuration is a little different.

It has two vCPUs, it has four gigs of Ram, and it can have up to four data disks that are attached.

So within the B series, B-2s, B-1s, B-2, miss B-1, LZ, and all other sizes have different hardware

configuration as well.

So the first thing that you need to do is to choose the family based on the type of workload that you

would want to run.

The next thing that you would choose is the size.

The size is based on the specific amount of hardware that you would want for your specific virtual machine.

Now let's close this.

So we chose the operating system.

That's by choosing the image.

We chose the hardware.

That's by choosing the family and the size.

And the last thing that we would want to focus on is attaching a disk.

So if you scroll up, you can go to disk in here, or you can do next disk clicking the button in here.

So I'll go ahead and say this.

And in this you can see that there is a boot disk which is always attached by default.

So whenever you want to create a virtual machine you'd want an operating system.

The operating system runs on the boot disk.

So this OS disk is the boot disk.

And in addition to the boot disk you can also attach data disks.

So you can add and configure additional data disks for your virtual machine or attach existing disks.

So you can go ahead and say create and attach a new disk and you can add a new disk.

It's very similar to attaching an additional hard drive with your computer.

So you can add more data disks to your virtual machine.

In this step, we looked at some of the key concepts with respect to Azure Virtual machines.

The first one is image.

It helps you to choose the operating system and the software that you would want on your virtual machine.

The next two are related to choosing the hardware VM family and VM size VM family changes based on the

type of workload you are running.

Do you want to run a general purpose application or a memory optimized application, or high performance

compute application?

And VM size helps you to choose a specific quantity of hardware you would want.

I want two vCPUs and four GB of memory.

You can choose the right size which has that amount of hardware and the last one is disks.

The boot disk is where your operating system would run from Every virtual machine will have a boot disk

attached with it.

In addition, you can also attach data disks with your virtual machine.

As you can see, cloud provides you with a lot of flexibility.

You can choose different types of operating systems.

You have different types of hardware which are available, and it gives you a lot of flexibility whenever

you are creating your virtual machines.

I'm sure you're having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
