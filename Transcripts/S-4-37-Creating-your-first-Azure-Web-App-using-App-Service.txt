In this step, let's quickly create a App Services Instance.

So, let's go ahead and choose App Services,

and this is where we can go ahead and say Create. So,

I would want to create a App Service Instance, I would want to create a Web App.

I can choose the Subscription as Free Trial. The resource group, I would choose is compute resource group.

The first thing that you'd need to configure is a name for the Web App.

What I would need to do, I would say my-first-web-app

and you can see that the name is not available, you have to make it unique.

What I would do is, I would add in in28minutes to make it unique.

Now, web apps allow you to deploy code as well as Docker container. So, you can either say Code and

choose which kind of code you'd want to deploy; you'd want .NET, or ASP, or Java.

So, you can choose whichever one you'd want to make use of or you can make use of a Docker container.

So, if you have a pre-built Docker container which is available, you can make use of it and you can run it on Web App.

What I would do is, I would make use of Docker container for now and I would choose operating system

as Linux.

I would choose the region as Central US. As we discussed earlier, whenever we are creating a App

Service Web App, you need to associate it with a App Service Plan. The App Service Plan decides what kind

of hardware is used to run your applications.

It decides the compute resources, the features, and the cost as well.

What we'll do now is create a new App Service Plan,

and what we'd do is we would choose Basic B1, which is the default plan which is suggested in here.

I'd go ahead and say

Next.

Instead of deploying a custom container, what we'll do is, we'll use the sample which is provided by Azure,

which is NGINX Server.

Earlier, we were deploying NGINX using a virtual machine.

Right now, we are deploying NGINX again, but this time using App Service. You'd now see how easy it is

to use App Service and deploy NGINX.

What I would do now is go ahead and say review and create.

The validation is in progress,

it would take a little while, I guess.

Okay, it took about 15 seconds, at the end of which I can go ahead and say create a Web App. The creation of

the Web App would take a little while.

What I would recommend you to do is to

take a break and I'll see you in the next step.
