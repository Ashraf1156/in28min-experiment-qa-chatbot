Welcome back. In this step,

let's look at some of the scenarios related to Azure Cloud Service categories. We looked at IaaS, PaaS, SaaS,

and Serverless. Let's look at a few scenarios related to them.

You are deploying custom application in virtual machines.

Which category does it fit into?

Yep, it is Infrastructure as a Service. Using Gmail, Software as a Service.

Using Azure App Service to deploy your application, Platform as a Service. Customer is responsible for

OS updates when using PaaS.

True or false?

The answer is false, because customer is no longer responsible for the operating system when he is using

PaaS.

True or false - Customer is responsible for Availability when using PaaS.

The answer is false.

The cloud provider would take care of the availability requirements.

The customer is only responsible for ensuring that the configuration is right. In PaaS, customer has access

to VM instances.

The answer is false. In PaaS, customer has access to configuration.

He'll not be able to directly access the VM instances.

In PaaS, customer can customize OS and install custom software. Again, false.

In PaaS, customer can configure auto-scaling needs. The answer to this is true. He can configure things,

he can configure hardware as well. So, he can configure hardware needs; memory, CPU, etc.

The answer to this, the answer to this is also true. PaaS services only offer compute services.

Is that true or false?

The answer is false.

Until now, we have looked at compute services, but there are a lot of other services; Databases, Skewing,

Big data, Machine Learning, IoT.

There are a lot of services which are offered by the cloud platforms under the PaaS category.

In this step, we looked at some of the important scenarios related to Azure Cloud Service Categories.

I'm sure you are having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
