Instructor: Congratulations on reaching

the first milestone of this course.

I'm really, really proud of you.

Not many learners start their online courses,

so you're doing something really awesome.

Congratulations again.

Now, the important question you need to ask always

whenever you are learning something new

is how to remember it for a long time.

I've learned something new, I remember it enough,

but how do I ensure

that I'll remember it one week down the line,

two weeks down the line, one month down the line,

and a year down the line?

I have found two very, very important things

that you can try doing to remember things for a long time.

Number one is active learning.

By active learning, I mean taking notes

when you are learning.

Make sure that whenever you see something interesting,

write it down.

Number two is regular review.

You can take your learning to your next level

by reviewing your notes every few days or every week.

Your brain has evolved over millions of years,

and the best way to remember things for a long time

is by taking notes and reviewing them regularly.

I'm a great believer in taking notes and reviewing them,

so I constantly write everything that I learn

and also I review whatever I've learned, regularly.

So a lot of my old notes

is something which I used to refer even today.

A number of learners ask me how I'm able

to learn so many programming languages, so many frameworks,

and how I'm proficient with so many cloud platforms.

I think taking notes and regularly reviewing my notes

is one of the most important reasons.

I'm sure you're having a great time

and I'll see you again very, very soon.
