Let's now start exploring virtual machine scale sets in Azure Portal.

Earlier we created a couple of VMs.

The first thing I would do is to delete these VMs.

It's very, very important to be careful when you delete these VMs.

What I'll do is get into my first VM, I'll say delete and I would say apply force delete.

And it's very, very important to choose to delete the network interfaces and public IP addresses as

well.

So you can see that I'm selecting Apply Force Delete and choosing to delete the OS disk.

The network interfaces the public IP addresses.

And I would go ahead and check this as well.

I have read and understand that this virtual machine, as well as any selected associated resources

listed above, will be deleted.

And let's go ahead and say delete.

So this will so this will kick start the deletion of my first VM.

What I'll also do is to go to virtual machines.

Go to my second VM and click delete on this as well.

Apply force delete network interfaces public IP addresses.

So I've checked all of them.

All these would be deleted.

And I would need to check this checkbox in here and say delete.

So this would delete all the resources for my second VM as well, because we are in the free trial.

There are restrictions on how many virtual machines we can create in parallel.

That's why you would want to ensure that we would want to delete these virtual machines before we get

started with scale sets.

What I recommend you to do is to wait for about 4 to 5 minutes before you would start with creation

of the scale set.

After about two minutes, my first VM is now deleted.

Let's also wait for the second VM to be deleted.

Even after waiting for five minutes, I see the second VM still in here.

Let's go and try deleting it again.

So let's go ahead and say delete.

Let's choose all the options in here.

So apply force delete OS disk network interfaces public IP addresses and check the checkbox and say

delete.

Okay, finally when I go to virtual machines I don't see any virtual machines in here.

That's pretty good.

What do you want to do is to create a virtual machine scale set.

So if you type in virtual machine scale set, you'd see virtual machine scale sets in here.

Earlier we created virtual machines.

Now we would want to create virtual machine scale sets.

So let's go and choose virtual machine scale sets and go ahead and say create.

So Azure Virtual Machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs.

The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined

schedule.

Scale sets provide high availability to your applications and allow you to centrally manage, configure,

and update a large number of VMs.

As usual, let's go ahead and select the resource group compute RG.

So let's choose the defaults for subscription.

Let's choose resource group as compute rg.

Next we would want to provide the virtual machine scale set name.

I'll configure the name as VM scale set one.

I'll recommend to choose the same region that you used when you were creating your previous virtual

machines.

You can also choose to distribute your virtual machines across multiple availability zones.

So I would say I would want to distribute my virtual machines across multiple zones zone one, zone

two, and zone three.

What we want to run is a very, very simple web application or a web page.

So I would go with uniform orchestration mode.

So I'll choose the uniform orchestration mode.

This is optimized for large scale.

This is optimized for large scale stateless workloads with identical instances.

We would want to create all VMs with identical configuration.

So I'll choose uniform as the orchestration mode.

When it comes to scaling, you have a number of options.

You can either choose to do it manually or you can say auto scale.

You can choose the metric that you want to use for auto scaling by clicking configure.

For now, let's keep it simple.

Let's say I would want to manually update the capacity.

I want to maintain a fixed amount of instances.

The initial number of instances I would want to create is two.

Let's leave it at two.

I'll choose the default image and size that are recommended.

As far as authentication is concerned, we will use the same pair that we used earlier.

So I'll say use existing key stored in Azure.

And I'll pick up the earlier option which is my first VM key.

So this is very very similar to how we have configured things earlier.

Now that we have the basics out of the way, let's go to its networking.

If you scroll down a bit you'd be able to see the network interface configuration.

A network interface enables an Azure Virtual Machine to communicate with the internet, Azure, and

on prem resources.

A virtual machine can have one or more network interfaces.

Basically, a network interface allows your virtual machine to communicate with other networks like

internet or other resources on Azure or on prem resources.

We would want to do a little bit of configuration on this network interface.

I'll click the edit icon which is present in here.

So edit network interface.

Over here what we want to do is to allow inbound traffic.

So public inbound ports, I want to say allow selected ports and go ahead and select the ports HTTP

and SSH.

So I'll allow inbound traffic on those two ports.

And I would also want to allow creation of public IP addresses.

So I'll say public IP address enabled.

So these are two important things that we are doing in here.

We are saying allow selected ports and we chose 80 and 22.

That's HTTP and SSH.

And we also enabled public IP addresses.

Once you do that you can say okay.

After that we would want to go ahead and create a load balancer.

We are creating multiple virtual machines.

Whenever a request comes, we would want to load balance the requests between the multiple VMs.

That's where we would want to create an Azure load balancer.

And over here we don't have an existing load balancer.

So what we would choose to do is to create a load balancer.

You can go ahead and say create a load balancer.

The first thing we need to configure is the name.

So I'll call this VM scale set.

Oops.

Let's get this right VM scale set one hyphen ELB.

I don't want a public load balancer.

I'll take the defaults for the rest of the things.

And I would say create.

Is that all?

There is just one more thing that you would want to configure that's basically in advanced tab.

So you need to go to the advanced tab.

And what do you want to configure in the advanced tab.

Yep.

This is exactly the same thing that we configured earlier.

We want to configure custom data.

You'd want to install.

We want to install nginx and set it up.

So I'll copy the same things from earlier in here.

So this is the same script that we used earlier as well.

This looks good.

Let's go ahead and say review and create.

Azure is doing the final validation.

The validation has passed.

It took about a few seconds and we are all set.

So we are creating two instances.

We are making use of my first VM key as the key pair.

We have configured to use load balancing and we have configured cloud init information.

Let's go ahead and say create.

The creation of the virtual machine scale set would take a while.

We are creating a couple of virtual machines.

In addition a load balancer is also being created.

So the creation of this would take a little while.

What I would recommend you to do is to take a break, grab a coffee and I'll see you on the other side.
