In the previous step, we initiated the process of creating a virtual machine.

It took a couple of minutes and after that I saw this message your deployment is complete.

And what I can do now is go to resource.

So this would take me to the virtual machine that we have just created.

Another way you can reach this is by typing the name.

So if you type in my hyphen first hyphen VM, you can pick the specific virtual machine from the resources.

Another way you can reach this screen is by typing in virtual machines.

Type in virtual machines.

Pick up virtual machines and you would see the my first VM in here.

And you can click this.

So this is the virtual machine screen of my first VM.

In this specific screen you can perform a number of operations.

With your virtual machine.

You can restart the virtual machine.

You can stop the virtual machine if you want.

You can even delete the virtual machine.

What we are interested in is we would want to connect to the virtual machine and execute a few commands.

And the way we can connect with the virtual machine is by clicking on connect.

Once you click connect, you should see an option called connect in here.

So click connect again.

And within a few seconds this page would load up.

And it would show the public IP address of the virtual machine.

So this is the address you can use to access to talk to the virtual machine.

And if you scroll down you should see an option called SSH using Azure CLI.

This would help us to quickly connect in the browser.

What I'll do is I'll do a select of this.

Once you click select, there would be a validation which is performed by Azure.

And within a few seconds you should see ready for configuration.

One of the things you'd see in here is that there are a number of prerequisites for connecting using

SSH using Azure CLI.

You'd see that some of these are green already.

Port 22 access is green.

Public IP address is green.

However, there are a few more things that we would need to enable.

The way we can do that is by first checking this checkbox.

What we are saying in here is I understand just in time policy on the virtual machine may be reconfigured

to allow any source IP to request, just in time, access to port 22.

This might sound very, very technical, but what we are saying is we are okay with enabling SSH access

to the specific virtual machine from any source IP addresses.

What I would do now is to go ahead and say configure and connect.

You can see that these three things are now being performed.

We don't really need to worry about the details of all these three for now.

We will talk about some of them a little later in the course.

For now, let's wait for all of them to complete.

Okay, took about five minutes and after that I see this screen come up which says Welcome to Azure

Cloud Shell.

If you had any problem with this, if the screen hanged or something like that, in that kind of scenario,

you can also close this SSH with Azure CLI and try again to connect using SSH using Azure CLI.

For me it was successful at the first attempt.

And I see this screen.

Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell.

In the Azure Cloud Shell you can either use bash or PowerShell.

I would recommend you to go with bash for now.

Let's go with bash on the screen you can say that you don't need the storage account, and I would choose

the subscription as whatever is the value which is present in here.

For me, I see free trial in here, so I choose free trial and I would go ahead and say apply.

So what we are doing is we are trying to connect to the virtual machine that we have created using SSH,

and we are making use of Azure CLI for doing that.

So we are basically launching up a command line.

Within a minute or so, you'd see that Azure would execute a command, and it would ask you if you want

to continue connecting, I would say yes.

After a few seconds, you should see the command prompt come up to make things easy for you.

I would actually increase the text size to large and I would go full screen.

So over here I can do a maximize.

So I'll do maximize so that you can see the entire screen which is present in here.

So we are now connected to the my first virtual machine from the command line.

If you type in who am I?

Who am I is a command a Linux command to find out the user ID who is logged in.

You can see that the user ID was logged in is in 28 minutes.

Dot Lerner at minutes.lerner@gmail.com.

You can also execute a command like Python three hyphen hyphen version.

So Python three space hyphen hyphen version.

This would return the version of Python which is installed.

Python 3.8. ten.

So this is the version of Python which is installed on this specific virtual machine.

So what we are doing now is connecting to the virtual machine and executing a few commands on it.

One of the most important things for you to remember is that the exact commands are not really, really

important.

There are a lot of technical concepts that are involved when we create and connect to a virtual machine,

you don't really need to understand all that.

Having a high level overview is more than sufficient as far as the exam is concerned.

I just wanted to show you what is involved in creating a virtual machine and connecting to it.

The exact commands here you don't really need to remember as far as the exam is concerned.

All that you need to remember is that you can create a virtual machine using Azure.

You can configure different hardware, you can configure different operating systems, and you can choose

how you'd want to connect to the specific virtual machine.

I'm sure you're having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
