Welcome back. In this step,

let's look at a few scenarios related to virtual machine. How can you automatically scale up and scale

down VMs? We can use scale sets

and we can enable auto scaling.

How can you protect VMs from data center failures?

I have a set of virtual machines.

Even if a specific data center fails, I don't want the entire application to go down.

How can we do that?

What we can do is to deploy them to multiple availability zones. To protect from a single data center

failure, you can deploy to multiple availability zones.

So, even if one of the data centers in an availability zone fails, you can serve the application from

another availability zone.

How much availability do you get by deploying two or more virtual machines in two or more availability zones in the

same region?

We already discussed about this.

It's 99.99%.

How can you perform disaster recovery for your VMs?

We looked at it as well,

Site Recovery. You can use Site Recovery to configure a secondary region and whenever there's a problem with

the primary region,

you would have disaster recovery performed and the VM would be copied over to the second region.

How can you reduce your costs for your VMs?

We looked at a few options. Auto scaling, which is elasticity, Reserved and Spot Instances.

Another factor that you need to typically consider when you talk about cost is selecting the right

region.

One of the important things to remember is that your costs for your VMs are not stable.

Cost vary with time and also costs vary from region to region.

Some regions might be cheap, some regions might be expensive.

If I go over to virtual machines and let's add a virtual machine. I'll choose compute-rg and let's give it

a name

and let's say Review and Create. And over here, you can see that B1s is 0.7493

Indian Rupees per hour.

This is applicable to East US region. So, it's 0.7493.

If I go back to previous

and go back to Basics and let's say I'd change the Region.

I would change it to, let's say,

Central India

and I'd say Review and Create.

You'd see that there is a change in price, this is 0.8069 INR per hour. There

is a small change in price over here.

If you'd want to see all the details around prices, the best place to go is Pricing Calculator.

If you do a Google for Azure Pricing Calculator, you'd land up on this and this is where you can configure

and estimate the costs for your Azure products. So, you can say virtual machines and virtual machine

is now added.

I can go and say, View and it would take me down to the virtual machines and you can see the cost.

So, you can see that for the specific configuration that we have in here, which is D2 v3,

Windows in West US, the compute price for pay as you go is about 85 dollars per month

and let's change it to some other region.

Let's just say I would change it to South India

and you can see that it increases up to 98 dollars.

You can see that there is a substantial increase.

As we discussed earlier, if you go for one year reserved, you'd get it cheaper. So, you'd get it for

62 US dollars.

If you go for three years reserved, you would see that it is further cheap,

it goes down to 39.53.

So, this is a good place where you can go and explore the costs related to all the services.

We will talk about Pricing Calculator in depth a little later as well.

So, to reduce the cost for your VMs, you can consider elasticity, auto scaling, reserved instances,

spot instances, and making sure that you are choosing the right region for your workload.

Next scenario, will you billed if you stop a VM?

The answer is yes.

Even though you stop the VM, there is disk storage which is attached with your VM.

You'd need to pay for it

and that's the reason why the best practice is to delete all the resources that are associated with

your VM if you don't want to get billed.

Next scenario, will two VMs of same size always cost the same?

We already talked about it.

The answer is no. Price changes with time and also price is different in different regions

and that's the reason why two VMs of the same size might not cost the same always.

The last question is, how can you know who performed a specific action on a specific VM or a Scale

Set?

The way you can do that is by using Activity logs.

These activity logs are kept for 90 days.

Where can you look at activity logs?

Let's go back to Virtual machines

and let's pick up our second virtual machine

and over here, you can actually type in activity.

It's right here.

This is where you can go in and look at all the activity logs around that specific virtual machine.

So, you can see Start Virtual Machine, Deallocate, Restart. So, all the events you can see them in

here. The same thing is also available on most other resources.

So, if I go to scale sets,

Virtual machine scale sets,

we have a Virtual machine scale set which is created, and this also has an activity log.

So, you can see that there are a lot of activities which are logged under the activity log for the VM scale

set.

I'm sure you had a wonderful time talking about virtual machines in the last few steps.

Our goal with this section was to give you a very good introduction to cloud computing with virtual machines.

As you can see, setting up applications with virtual machines is not a very, very easy task.

You need to configure a lot of things to get your applications running on virtual machines

and that's where we would start focusing on managed services, starting next section.

I'm sure you are having a wonderful time and I'll see you in

the next step.
