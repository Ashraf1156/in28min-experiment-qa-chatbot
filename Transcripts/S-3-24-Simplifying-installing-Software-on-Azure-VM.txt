In the previous step, we saw that we had to SSH into the virtual machine.

We had to execute a number of commands, and only after that we were able to install nginx and get it

up and running.

How do we simplify this?

How do we get this done in an easier manner?

Let's explore that further in this specific step.

And let's go back to virtual machines.

We have earlier created the my first VM.

What we'll do now is to create another VM, but in a much easier way.

Let's go ahead and say Create Azure Virtual Machine.

And I would choose the things that we chose earlier.

So I would take the resource group as compute RG.

So this is a resource group which we created earlier when we created our first VM.

I'll call this my second VM.

So the virtual machine name is my second VM.

You can use the same region that you used earlier when you were creating the first virtual machine.

You can choose the defaults for all the other options over here.

You can see that for this size over here it's available if I change the region.

For example, if I actually go in.

I was just checking this a little while ago.

If I go to East US, I saw that there is no capacity available.

So if you see a message like this, the size is currently unavailable in East US for this specific subscription,

then what I would recommend you to do is to change the region and check.

As of now, when I checked this region, the Australia East had the size B1 as available.

When I choose that, you can see that the message in here disappears.

So this is all good.

What I would want to do is to reuse the SSH public key that we created earlier.

So what I would do is instead of generating new key pair I'll say use existing key stored in Azure.

And let's select the my first VM key that we created in the that we created when we were creating the

first virtual machine.

I'll also select inbound ports HTTP and ssh ssh ssh is selected by default.

I'll also add HTTP in.

All.

This is very similar to what we did when we were creating the first virtual machine.

In addition, what we want to do is to execute a set of commands while the virtual machine is starting

up.

And that's why we are going into the advanced tab.

In the advanced tab, you can configure custom data and cloud init.

So you can configure custom data in here.

Basically you can actually put something in here which will be executed when the VM is started up.

Now what do we want to execute in here.

This set of commands is made available to you in the previous step.

If you go back to the previous step you would see something like this in there.

So this is to say, the first line is to say that we are going to execute a bash script.

The second line is to become a root, the next one is to update the packages and the next one is to

install nginx.

So I'll copy these two at the same time.

And the last one is welcome to in 28 minutes.

And the host name in here.

And we are piping this out to index dot HTML file.

This is very very similar to what we did earlier in the previous step.

You should see this text available.

You can just copy paste it in and you should not have a problem.

As I said earlier, understanding these commands is not really, really important.

What is important to understand is that you can configure custom data, and this script would be running

at startup.

Once you configure custom data, you can go ahead and say review and create enough.

I would go ahead and say create.

So deployment is being submitted.

It will take a couple of minutes I guess, before the virtual machine is ready.

The deployment is now in progress.

Let's wait for the deployment to complete.

Cool.

The deployment is now complete.

So what I can do is I can say go to resource.

So the second VM is now created for us.

It has a public ID.

It has a public IP which is assigned in here.

So let's copy the public IP.

Let's go over and run it.

So 20 .73.212.228 is the public IP that I have.

You might have something different or that you need to do is to take that and put it in the browser.

Sometimes the browsers directly change this to Https.

Make sure that you're not using Https.

Make sure that you're still using HTTP.

So you can say http colon slash slash this if you have a problem.

And still getting that this site can't be reached.

What we would need to do is to wait for a minute or so before this second VM is completely available

for us.

Okay, I refreshed after a couple of minutes and I can see.

Welcome to 28 minutes my second VM.

If you don't see this, make sure that you're using HTTP and not Https.

So it should be http colon slash slash this URL.

That's one mistake.

The other one is to make sure that you wait for sufficient amount of time.

If you wait for 4 to 5 minutes, you should see this come up.

In this step, we looked at how we can simplify the setup of some software on your virtual machine.

Earlier.

We had to SSH into it.

We had to execute a few commands and only then we were able to get the software installed.

But now, by configuring custom data in cloud init, we were able to quickly get it up and running.

All that we needed to do is while creating the virtual machine, we configured custom data and it was

automatically executed at the startup of the VM, and we were able to have our nginx server up and running,

I'm sure having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
