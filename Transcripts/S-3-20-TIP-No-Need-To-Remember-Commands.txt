A quick word of warning before we get into the next step.

In the next step, we would be installing a web server called nginx.

We would want to install this nginx on our virtual machine, and we would want to launch up a simple

web page on nginx.

And to do this, we would need to execute a lot of complex commands.

If you are not familiar with Linux, a lot of these commands might seem really, really complex.

A very, very important thing to remember is that you don't really need to remember any of these commands

for the exam.

All that you need to understand is a high level overview of what we are doing in here For each of the

commands that we will be executing, we will give you a proper explanation, but there is no need to

get tensed about remembering these commands because you don't really need to remember them.

We are also making these commands available in the next step.

So what you can do is to copy the commands and have them handy so that you can copy them and execute

them whenever you need to.

At in 28 minutes, our goal is to make things as easy as possible for you, and I'm sure you are having

a great learning experience until now.

I'll see you in the next step.
