Welcome back, I'm Ranga Karanam.

I'm all excited to be your instructor for this course. Azure has more than 200 services.

A little later in the course, we will be logging into Azure portal and you'll be able to see all the different services which are present in Azure.

When I started with Azure a few years back, they were half the number of services you are seeing right now.

This is an ever-growing list of services.

This specific exam expects you to have knowledge of 40+ services. This exam tests your decision-making abilities; which service do you choose in which situation. This course is designed to help you make those choices.

Our goal with this course is not only to help you get certified, but also to help you understand Cloud computing and understand the various Azure services in depth.

We would want you to be able to take the knowledge you gained in this course and apply it in your real-world projects.

How can you make the best use of this course? How can you put your best foot forward?

This is a very challenging certification. This expects you to understand and remember a number of services. You are human, I'm human, and as humans, we tend to forget things over time.

If I'm learning something new today, it is highly probable that I'll be forgetting it in a week's time. How do you ensure that you improve your chances of remembering things?

Here are a couple of recommendations based on my experience:

Number one is Active Learning - think and take notes. Whenever you see something interesting in the course, write it down.

The second recommendation is to review the presentation once in a while; every few days or every week. Take a step back, review the presentation and videos, and think about what you have learned.

The more you are actively involved with the learning and the more you review, the higher the chances for you to remember things for a long time.

Now, what is our approach to building a great course? We are taking a three-pronged approach.

We have amazing video presentations where we would introduce the different Azure services to you. We also have designed a number of amazing demos where you will be playing with the Azure services.

We also have two different kinds of quizzes to reinforce your learning. We have the traditional text quizzes where you have questions, multiple-choice answers, and you pick the right answer.

We also have video quizzes where we discuss the scenarios, solutions, and the different variations that are possible on the solution.

By using this three-pronged approach, we think you'll be able to remember things for a long time and you'll do really, really well at the exam.

Now, before we move into the next step, there are a couple of recommendations for you.

Number one, this is not a race. Take your time, focus on understanding things well, and do not hesitate to replay videos when needed.

The second, but the most important recommendation, is to have fun. Preparing for certifications can get really boring and that's why we have invested a lot of time to try and make this course really interactive, really hands-on, and making sure that you will have a lot of fun while you learn.

I'm really excited to help you get Azure certified and I'll see you in the next step.
