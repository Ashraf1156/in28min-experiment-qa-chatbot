In this quick step, let's delete our scale set and also create another test VM so that we can use that

in the further steps.

Let's go back to VM scale sets.

What I want to do is to delete this.

So I would say select this and delete.

And I would say apply force delete.

And I would say delete in here.

Now I can go ahead and say delete.

So this will delete all the resources that are associated with this scale set.

Let's go ahead and say delete.

Cool.

It's now executing the delete command on the selected item which is the virtual machine scale set.

Now while that is in progress, what we'll do is we'll go ahead and create a virtual machine instance.

So virtual machines let's go to virtual machines.

You want to create a virtual machine.

Let's choose the resource group as compute RG and I'll call this my second VM.

So we are going to use the same name as the earlier one.

We have earlier deleted the second VM.

So we'll recreate with the same name so that we can use it in the subsequent steps.

I will choose the defaults for the rest of the things.

Um, I'll scroll down further and actually choose the SSH public key source as use existing key stored

in Azure.

Let's choose the my first VM key.

Let's also enable HTTP and SSH ports.

And after that, we would want to go over to the advanced and configure custom data as well.

So I'll copy this, put it in here and I'll remove this line.

So this is exactly how we configured it earlier.

You should find this script in a text lecture in one of the previous lectures as well.

So that's all.

We are all set to create the virtual machine.

Let's go ahead and review and create.

Azure would perform the validation quickly hopefully running final validation.

Okay.

Validation passed.

And we can go ahead and create the virtual machine.

Okay.

The creation of the virtual machine is now kick started.

That's cool.

I'll also make sure that the virtual machine scale set is deleted.

So virtual machine scale sets.

Let's go back.

You can see that the virtual machine scale set is now deleted.

What I noticed was when I went to load balancers.

So if I search for load balancers in here and go to load balancer, the load balancer still existed.

So the load balancer which was created by the scale set was in here.

VM scale set one ELB.

So what I would want to do is to go ahead and delete this as well.

So let's go inside.

And say delete.

Let's go ahead and delete the load balancer.

This would delete the load balancer for us.

So what we have done is to delete the scale set the load balancer.

And we have created our second VM again.

I'm sure having a wonderful time.

And I'll see you in the next step.
