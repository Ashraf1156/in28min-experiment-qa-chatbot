Instructor: Time is precious. You only have 24 hours in a day, and therefore optimizing every minute is really, really important.

Do you know I watch most of my content at 2x speed and I've experienced significant time savings because of this habit? This is called speed watching. You can accelerate video content to 1.25x, 1.5x, or even 2x to save time. The Udemy video interface also supports this.

**Why should you speed watch?**  
1. **Time Savings:**  
   If you're watching a one-hour tutorial at 1.5x speed, you can complete the entire tutorial in 40 minutes. That means you are saving 20 minutes for yourself.  

However, it's very, very important to remember the best practices when it comes to speed watching:  
1. **Comprehension vs Speed:**  
   Make sure that you are understanding everything. Don't just play the video at a high speed if you're not able to understand everything in the video. If you're not able to understand things at a higher speed, go to a lower speed and play it at that pace. Ensure comprehension is not sacrificed for speed.  

2. **Start Slow:**  
   If you're watching at 1x right now, begin with a slight increase, such as 1.25x. Once you get adjusted to 1.25x, consider moving to higher speeds. Incrementally adjust to higher speeds rather than jumping directly to 2x.  

Time is really, really precious. We only have 24 hours in a day, and that's why optimizing every minute is important. One of the things I really believe in is that investing in yourselves is the best investment you can make.

I'm really, really glad you're investing your time to learn this course. I'll see you in the next step.
