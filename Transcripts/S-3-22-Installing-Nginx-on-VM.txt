Welcome back.

In the previous steps, we created a virtual machine and we connected to it.

In this step, let's try and install some useful software on it.

We will try and install a HTTP server.

You have a few web pages and you would want to serve them from a HTTP server.

The specific HTTP server that we are going to make use of is something called nginx.

Nginx is one of the most popular web servers out there.

We will try and install nginx in this specific step.

Are you excited to install your first piece of software on a virtual machine?

Let's get started!

All the commands that we'll be using are made available to you in the course as part of the previous

lecture.

These are also available in the course presentation.

What I would recommend you to do is to copy all these commands, copy them and put them into a text

editor of your choice.

So I copied them and put them into a text editor of my choice.

Any text editor should be fine.

Notepad or Textpad or Sublime Text, or any text editor of your choice should be fine.

All that you need to be able to do is to do a copy paste.

So you should be able to copy the command from here and paste it.

Before we run any command, the first thing we would want to ensure is that we are connected to the

virtual machine.

So if I type in who am I in here, for example, you can see that in 28 minutes.

Lerner at gmail.com is coming up.

If you don't see something, if you see a connection, error or something, the first thing you can

do is to close this and you can go ahead to virtual machines.

Let's go back to virtual machines.

Pick up the first virtual machine.

You can say connect, connect.

And the thing which we are doing is to SSH using Azure CLI.

So let's do a select in here.

And all these should be preconfigured for us.

So let's go ahead wait for the validation to complete okay.

It took about 15 seconds after which the validation was complete.

And I can see the cloud shell come up.

Now, I can maximize this and I can use this to run my commands.

Let me wait for a little enough.

Cloud shell is ready to accept my commands over here.

The first command I will execute is clear.

Clear.

All that it does is to clear the screen.

So clear will clear the screen.

And it will take the cursor to the top of the command line.

This will enable you to see the commands clearly.

Over here you can type in a command like who am I?

This gives you the user ID.

Now what I want to do is to install some software on this specific virtual machine.

And to install the software you need admin permissions.

How do I get admin permissions?

The command in Linux to be able to do that is sudo su.

So now I have admin permissions to sudo space.

Su will give me admin access.

So you can see that now I have root access I can install any software that I would want to install.

That's the command in here sudo su.

Next I would want to install nginx.

That's the HTTP server that we would want to install.

However, before installing nginx we would want to ensure that everything related to packages on the

specific virtual machine is up to date.

The package manager that we are making use of is apt.

Hyphen git.

You don't really need to worry about the details in here.

The package manager is apt get, and we would want to ensure that all the packages are up to date,

and this is the command we use to ensure that the packages are up to date.

So it's apt.

Hyphen get space hyphen y space update.

The exact command is not really important.

Let's go ahead and copy it and execute it.

So apt.

Hyphen hyphen update sorry hyphen y update.

And you can see that the packages are now up to date.

Once the packages are up to date, we can go ahead and install Enginex.

The way we can install Enginex is by using another apt get apt get is like a package manager.

We are telling this package manager hey package manager, go ahead and install nginx.

I want to install nginx on my on my virtual machine.

Let's copy this command.

It's apt get hyphen y install nginx.

You can go ahead and say enter.

And this would install nginx on the virtual machine.

The installation would take a minute or so.

So let's wait for the installation to complete.

Yep, the installation is now complete.

Let's do a clear so that we can go back to the top.

So I executed clear command to go back to the top.

And over here and over here we want to check that Ingenix is properly installed.

How can we check if the ingenix is properly installed or not?

Once a web server is installed on the virtual machine, we should be able to use a URL and access the

web server.

How can we get the URL?

How can we get the IP address?

That's where we would go back to the second tab that we opened up earlier.

This is where we were playing with the Azure Web portal.

This way we are playing with the web application of the Azure portal.

The way you can bring it up is by clicking the hamburger icon.

And you can probably say right click on home and say Open in New tab.

I have already done that and this is already opened in here and over here.

What you want to find out is the URL of the nginx server, which is installed on our virtual machine.

I'll go over to virtual machines, or you can type in virtual machines in here.

So you can type in virtual machines.

Okay.

That's not a problem.

Your portal Azure.com says your unsaved edits will be discarded.

No problem.

I'll say okay.

And I can see my first.

And I can see my first VM in here.

I'll click that.

And over here, if you scroll down you'd be able to see the public IP address.

This is what we would want to copy.

So this is what you would want to copy.

Now it's copied.

And I'll open up a new tab and put that in here.

So 20 dot 70 dot 214 .203.

Your VM will have a different public IP address.

That's not a problem.

So let's go ahead and press enter.

It will take a few seconds at the end of which you should see welcome to nginx.

If you see this page the nginx web server is successfully installed and working.

We can further configure it, but the basic nginx web server is now successfully installed and working.

If you have problems accessing this, the first thing that I would recommend you to do is to check that

you are not using Https.

So if you're using https, colon 20 dot 70 dot 214 .203.

That will not work.

What we will need to do is to use HTTP.

So if you are seeing https in your URL when you go to the browser, then change it to HTTP.

So if you type in http colon slash slash 20 dot 70 dot two, 14 dot 2 or 3, whichever is the IP address

that you have, you should see.

Welcome to nginx.

Come up.

Now just to make this further interesting, let's try and customize this page instead of this.

Welcome to nginx.

I would want to see Hello World in here.

How can I do that?

The command to do that is in here.

Echo getting started with Azure Virtual Machines and we would want to pipe it to this specific file.

Now you might be wondering what are we doing in here.

Right.

So this looks like a very complex command.

So let's try and break it down.

So let's go back to command line.

And over here let's type in echo.

Let's say echo.

Hello world.

What does this do?

If I type in echo hello world between double quotes it would type Hello World to the screen.

So echo is actually printing Hello World to the screen.

Now what we want to do is we would want to store Hello World in a specific file.

This is the default file which is being served by nginx.

We would want to change this.

We want to put hello world into this specific file.

The path of this specific file that we would want to change is this slash where slash dub dub dub slash

HTML, slash index dot HTML.

And what we want to do is to send this text into this specific file.

And that's why we are using the output redirection operator, which is greater than we would want to

print this piece of text.

Whatever is the piece of text which is outputted, we would want to redirect into this specific file.

And what nginx does is it will pick up the content of this file and serve it.

As I said before, the specifics of the commands are not really important.

What is very important to remember is that we are customizing the web page which is installed on the

nginx server.

Let's go ahead and copy this command and paste it in here.

So echo getting started with Azure Virtual Machines and we are redirecting it to this specific file.

Now the redirection is complete I'll go back to the browser, the URL, the public IP we executed earlier

and you can do a refresh or press enter.

Here you can see that it's showing getting started with Azure Virtual machines.

Now the next thing I would want to do is to show the name of the virtual machine in here.

Which virtual machine is returning the response back.

One of the commands in Linux, which can help you to find the name of the VM is host name.

So if you type in host name you would see that my first VM is printed.

So if I actually do echo for example and say host name, what do you expect?

Echo within double quotes I'm putting in host name.

What will you expect.

It's actually printing the text host name.

It's not printing the name of the virtual machine.

Now if I want to print the name of the virtual machine, then the way I can do that is by saying echo

and inside dollar parentheses.

Host name and close parentheses and double quotes.

And now I can go ahead and execute this.

So you can see that my first VM is now printed.

Now what I want to do is to print a simple message like this.

Echo.

Welcome to in 28 minutes host name.

hostname.

And I would want to show it in here.

The way I can do that is by executing this command and redirecting the output to the same file as we

did earlier.

So I'll copy this command.

And execute it in here.

So echo welcome to in 28 minutes hostname.

And we are redirecting it to this specific file.

And now if I go back to the browser and refresh, you'd see.

Welcome to 28 minutes and the name of the VM that we have configured.

Now you might be wondering why did we do so many complex things in this specific step?

The thing is, the name of the VM is something we'll use in the demos a little later.

That's why we wanted to ensure that when we go to this URL, we'll be able to see the name of the VM.

One of the important things I would want to stress again is that you don't really need to remember the

exact commands which are executed in here.

Some of these commands are really complex Linux commands, having a high level understanding of what

we are doing in here.

The fact that we created a virtual machine, we installed Enginex on it, and we are trying to customize

the text that we show on the web page.

That's basically all that you need to remember to be able to install nginx and customize the page in

here.

You saw that there are a lot of complex commands that you would need to execute, and before we execute

the commands we needed to SSH into the Azure Virtual Machine.

How do we simplify this?

How do we install software without even connecting to the virtual machine directly?

That's what we'll be looking at in the next step.

I'm sure you're having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
