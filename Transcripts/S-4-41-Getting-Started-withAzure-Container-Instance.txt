Welcome back.

In this step, let's look at one of the important Platform as a Service offerings in Azure related to

containers, which is Azure Container Instances. Azure Container Instances help you to manage and

run simple container-based applications. Just like App Service,

you don't really need to worry about provisioning or managing your virtual machines. Azure Container

Instances can help you to start containers in a few seconds.

One important thing to remember is that even with Azure App Service you can deploy simple containers,

that's what we did with NGINX earlier. Azure Container Instances makes it even more simpler to run containers.

Let's quickly take a look at how you can use container instances.

How do we create a container instance?

You can just type in container instances in here.

So, Container instances. Container instances is what we have picked up

and I would want to create a container instance.

And you would see that creating a container instance is very, very easy. As usual, select the subscription,

resource group, compute-rg. The container name,

I would say my-first-container-instance and I would choose region as East US.

Let's pick up one of the Quickstart images which is provided by Azure. So, Quickstart images and let's use the

helloworld which is provided by Azure itself, and let's use the size which is selected by default in here.

And after that I can go ahead and say review and create. It's running the final validation right now.

This would take about a few seconds usually, so let's wait for it to complete.

And right now I can go ahead and say Create.

The creation of the container instance would take a little while. It took a few minutes and our container

instance is now ready.

If I go over to the container instance, I can see all the details.

You have the public IP address in here.

I'll copy this and launch it up over here

and it says Welcome to Azure Container Instances. We were able to easily deploy an application to Azure Container

Instances. Over here, you can actually start, stop, and delete the container instance.

You can also look at the Activity log.

You can look at the different containers.

So, this is the container which we are making use of right now.

If you go to the Logs in here, you can see the logs behind that specific container.

If you go back to the Overview, we can also see some of the metrics related to the container right

in here.

So, you can see CPU, Memory, Network bytes received,

and all those details in here. As you can see, container instances makes it very, very easy to deploy

containers to Azure.

However, one of the biggest challenges with container instances is that they don't provide advanced

orchestration features. That's what we would start exploring starting the next step.
