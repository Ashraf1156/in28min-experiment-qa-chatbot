Welcome back. In this step, let's delete all the resources that we have created earlier.

I'll choose the compute-rg or you can type in compute-rg and select the resource group.

And we have created all the resources in this specific resource group.

And therefore, what I can do is to just delete the resource group and everything else that is underneath the

resource group would be deleted.

You can see that there are a lot of resources that we created as part of this resource group.

So, all of them would be deleted as soon as this resource group is deleted.

That is one of the biggest advantages of creating a resource group.

Everything is created under the same resource group and you'd see that most of the services create a number

of resources and deleting them individually will be very, very tough.

And that's where, if you group everything as part of a single resource group, you can easily manage

them.

You can manage the lifecycle of them.

And when and when you're done with using them, you can delete them easily as well.

So, I've typed in the resource group name here and I'm going to say Delete and this would delete all the things

that we have created during the compute section of this specific

course. Whenever we are using the cloud,

it's very, very important to ensure that you are making efficient use of the cloud resources.

Right now we are in the free tier, so you might not be really paying for the usage of the cloud,

but deleting resources that you don't need in the cloud is a very good habit to get into.

What I would recommend you to do is at the end of every learning session, I would recommend you to

delete all the resources and create them again when you're going to start with the course again. I'm sure you are

having a wonderful time and I'll see you in the next step.
